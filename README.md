# This is a test task made for LyraSolar

## Chosen technologies:
TypeScript, Next / React, MobX, ThreeJS & React-Three-Fiber, Jest

## The architectural concept is quite straightforward:
1) As simple as possible -> that keeps code small, interactions clear & data flow obvious
2) React is used to handle UI / UX interactions, speaks to MobX
3) MobX is used to tie application together, store our objects and handle interactions with TreeJS
4) Jest is used to unit test & integration test of different components & modules

# New approaches & technologies
- I never worked with ThreeJS, but I've worked with Konva and understand the mechanisms at play
- I haven't tested Canvas interactions before
- I haven't worked with MobX, through I've worked with Vuex / Pinia so understand the concept
